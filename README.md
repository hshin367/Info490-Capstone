**Project Title:**

- Restore

**Project Summary:**

- Our solution is a gamified website aimed to raise public awareness of beach cleanups in order to combat the growing threat of pollution. Through our website, users will have the opportunity to grow a community and obtain achievements for finding and attending local beach cleanups.

**Project Research:**

- User Interviews
  - We conducted multiple rounds of user interviews in order to receive direct feedback from our potential users to drive our design decisions. Through our research, we were able to iterate and polish our designs to best meet the needs of our target audience.
- Preliminary Research
  - Along with frequent user interviews, we performed preliminary research consisting of market analysis and a literature review to help build the foundation for our project.

**Project Design Tools:**

- Figma
- Procreate

**Project Design:**

- Glassmorphism
  - Our current designs reflect Glassmorphic UI which uses the frosty glass aesthetic and dimensional layers.
- Graphical Design
  - With our vision for the aquarium, we decided to aim for a more graphical design (avoiding the usage of photos). This was achieved by designing each individual fish in Procreate and adding them to the database.
- Customization
  - Many users voiced the desire for customization capabilities in our product, so we design pages and interactions that allow users to do just that (i.e the aquarium decorations, light vs dark mode, etc.)

**Recommended Software:**

- VSCode
- Insomnia
- Google Chrome

**Repositories**

There is one repository for the frontend and backend. Please contact our team to become a collaborator if you are interested.

**Frontend:**

[https://github.com/hshin367/Info490-Capstone](https://github.com/hshin367/Info490-Capstone)

The frontend is written in javascript using React.js. For certain pages, additional frameworks are used, such as Material.ui, styled-components and ant-d. For more information, contact Jin, Chris and Thomas. All relevant code for the Restore project is inside the &quot;ocean&quot; folder. All contents outside the &quot;ocean&quot; folder are from an early prototype of the website, and does not affect the functionality of the Restore web application.
